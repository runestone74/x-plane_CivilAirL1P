Civil Air L1P demo plane used in Swedish PPL examination for X-Plane 11
This is copied from the specifications in the book for a virtual plane refered to in PPL examination in Sweden.

My thoughts are to include all specifications that are available as accurate as possible just as an exercise in building an airplane from scratch and also to have a more tangible plane to look around and even fly while learning to fly in real life.
